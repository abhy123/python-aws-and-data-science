There are two main sections of this repo and it uses python and its libraries and also AWS :

1) Data Science exploration for real estate
Snsplots :
Used Seaborn and matplotlib library to visualize the data for real estate in bangalore. It predominantly assists in making statistical
graphics. Also, used have used pandas for data science and machine learning tasks and to read and plot data from the csv file.

Linear and Logistic Regression :
I have used these models to predict and plot graphs. Exceptions have been removed from the input source. Have used training data
and also plotted heatmaps. Have also evaluated confusion matrix, accuracy score and classification report.


2) Using Flask with AWS Dynamo DB and to create AWS (Serverless Application Model)SAM templates
Dynamo DB :
Dynamo db is nothing but a nosql db and I have basically tried APIs to insert, delete data in dynamo db

AWS SAM :
Using AWS is awesome. But to make sure the infra releases are easy and manageable, we should build templates,
which will make deployments and environments creations easy on the fly. That is what is explored in this section.
